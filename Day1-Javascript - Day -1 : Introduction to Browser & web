HTTP 1.1
• It uses text based commands for HTTP requests.
• It added many performance enhancements e.g. caching, request pipelining, keepalive connections, transfer encoding, byte range requests etc.
• It can load one request at a time. One request per one TCP connection is possible.
HTTP 2
• It is binary and not textual and completely multiplexed.
• It interleaves multiple requests/responses in parallel without blocking on anyone.
• It uses a single TCP connection to deliver multiple requests/responses (in parallel).
• It uses header compression in order to reduce overhead.
• It allows servers to "push" responses into client caches proactively.
